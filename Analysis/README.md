# About the Analysis folder
This is where I am going to put some code samples that highlight how to query and analyze the data in `R` and `python`.

## Some research ideas
1. Does the discussion around the debate(s) change over the period of a day?
2. Plot the network around the discussion of the `#debate` hashtag.  How big is it?  Who is influential?
3. How many tweets include links?  How many tweets are only links?  Does this suggest spam?

## TO DO:
- Cleanup the scripts, as they are not currently running.
- Figure out why the R script failed after 160K records.
  - Did the MongoDB cursor time out?
