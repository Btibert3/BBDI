# About This Project

## Overview
I wanted to share some code that I built to parse the Twitter log files using python and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), a NoSQL database.  The goal is to highlight how we could parse and analyze a _small sample_ of the data we collected on our local machines.  Of course, this is not a substitute for production environment, but it could prove to be useful for anyone that wants to get an idea as to what the data look like.

## Required Tools
- Python: On Linux/Mac, this is already installed.  I used version 2.7
- MongoDB:  The installation is real easy from the command line.


When developing Python code, it is worth looking into ipython, and more specifically, the ipython web notebook, a web-based tool that allows us to rapidly test and build code.  I use ipython to write my code samples, download the python code snippets and then clean the final script. Also, Spyder is an RStudio-like IDE that can be helpful as well.

In addition, I wrote this README file using the markdown language and an online editor which can be found at <http://markable.in>.


## Git
I created a git project hosted on Github so we can host our code here.  This allows for us to collaborate on the code we develop for various aspects of the BBDI project.
